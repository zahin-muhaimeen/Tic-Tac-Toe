Tic-Tac-Toe written as a graphical application in python.

This is a fun project that I made to practice my coding skills in python, and also math logic.

** Requirements

- Python 3.8.4+ (Tested from version 3.8.4 - 3.9.5)
- Tkinter (Python module)

** Fix or Add

- FIXME Prioritize offense over defense
When the 'AI' is given the choice between a win, or blocking a player's win, it choses to block.

- TODO Add an option to choose between 'player vs computer' and 'player vs player'
- TODO Add an option to choose between player 'X' and player 'Y'
